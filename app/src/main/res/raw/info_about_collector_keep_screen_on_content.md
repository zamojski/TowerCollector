Use this option to keep screen on at selected level of brightness when collecting measurements. The screen will remain on even if you switch to a different application or try to turn it off using power button. Enabling will significantly shorten battery life.

This may be used as a workaround to keep cell and signal strength details updated on some devices when using Android 1.0 API.

To keep screen on only when main screen is visible, see the option in Display section.
