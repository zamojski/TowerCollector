Copyright © 2012-%CURRENT_YEAR% Adam Zamojski & Contributors

Tower Collector is designed to collect GPS locations of GSM/UMTS/LTE/CDMA/5G NR/TD-SCDMA cell towers. Your collected measurements can be uploaded to many public and private databases.

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.]]></string>
  <string name="about_collector_api_version_content"><![CDATA[You can decide what method will be used to get cell tower details when collecting measurements.

*It is strongly recommended to use the latest available to get more reliable data. Selection is disabled on devices running Android 4.1 and earlier.*

*   **Auto detect** - The app will automatically detect which version of API can be used and select the best option. It will use safe option if Collector started when there is no signal.
*   **Android 4.2 API** - Uses methods available on Android 4.2 and newer. These methods provide the most reliable cell info. However some manufacturers did not implement new API correctly and it may not be used on such devices. On Android 5.1 and newer cell towers from multiple SIM cards may be returned.
*   **Android 1.0 API** - Uses a set of methods available since first version of Android. These methods may return unreliable data for LTE and UMTS networks. Depending on the device, this method may require the screen to remain on while collecting to keep cell info updated correctly.]]></string>
  <string name="about_collector_keep_screen_on_content"><![CDATA[Use this option to keep screen on at selected level of brightness when collecting measurements. The screen will remain on even if you switch to a different application or try to turn it off using power button. Enabling will significantly shorten battery life.

This may be used as a workaround to keep cell and signal strength details updated on some devices when using Android 1.0 API.

To keep screen on only when main screen is visible, see the option in Display section.]]></string>
  <string name="about_main_keep_screen_on_content"><![CDATA[Use this option to keep screen on at full brightness when main screen is presented on device. Once you leave the screen or switch to a different application the Android defined behavior will be restored. Enabling will significantly shorten battery life.

  <string name="about_notify_measurements_collected_content"><![CDATA[Tower Collector can notify other apps installed on the system by broadcasting *intents*. For more information how to listen for and consume such notifications check that app's help.

### Measurements collected event

Collector can send an intent every time new set of measurements is collected if set in Preferences. The content of notification will be a JSON structure with common things like time and GPS extracted. Field names and values are mapped the same way as in exported CSV file.
List of fields used by cells depend on type (net_type). Unsupported or missing values will be set to `null`.

- GSM - mcc, mnc, lac, cell_id, asu, dbm, ta, rssi, arfcn
- UMTS - mcc, mnc, lac, cell_id, short_cell_id, rnc, psc, asu, dbm, ec_no, arfcn
- CDMA - sid → mnc, nid → lac, bid → cell_id, asu, dbm, cdma_dbm, cdma_ecio, evdo_dbm, evdo_ecio, evdo_snr
- LTE - mcc, mnc, tac → lac, ci → cell_id, short_cell_id, rnc, pci → psc, ta, asu, dbm, rsrp, rsrq, rssi, rssnr, cqi, arfcn
- 5G NR - mcc, mnc, tac → lac, nci → cell_id, pci → psc, asu, dbm, csi_rsrp, csi_rsrq, csi_sinr, ss_rsrp, ss_rsrq, ss_sinr, arfcn

  <string name="best_practices_content"><![CDATA[Tower Collector is a perfect app for OpenCellID and BeaconDB contributors who want to support the projects with measurements from their area. It is good to know what is the right way to collect the most valuable measurements during walks and trips.

- Avoid moving back and forth exactly the same way every day. A large number of duplicated measurements will not be very useful.
- Try to map new places, especially those less frequently visited as they're often still not covered. Many of the towers along main streets have already been mapped.
- From time to time make a round again to collect new cell towers that could appear in your area.
- Collect data for all kinds of networks supported by your device, such as GSM, UMTS, LTE, CDMA, 5G NR, TD-SCDMA, etc. You can achieve this by changing preferred network types in Android settings.
- Use SIM cards from many different network operators to better cover your area.]]></string>
  <string name="external_integration_content"><![CDATA[Tower Collector exposes tasks to be run by other applications that send *intents* like Tasker, Automate or Llama. You need to use *Broadcast* type for all activities defined below. For more information how to do such integration check that's applications help.
*Like within the app you can't start more than one task at the same time!*

  <string name="introduction_content"><![CDATA[### The purpose

The app is designed to collect GPS coordinates correlated with information about mobile cell towers. It is designed to help map the extent of mobile phone network coverage.

### How to start

To start select 'Start collecting' option (record icon) from menu on the top of the screen. Measurements will be collected only when you're in range of mobile network and GPS gives your position with at least 40 meters accuracy.

### Next steps

Collected data can be uploaded to OpenCellID.org and BeaconDB projects or exported to a file. Before first upload you will need to select projects you want to contribute to. In case of OpenCellID.org you'll additionally need to register for free and enter received access token in Preferences. Measurements will be deleted from your device after successful upload.

  <string name="privacy_statement_content"><![CDATA[The privacy is very important, so the application collect and transmit only the required information to provide the services. The application does NOT collect, store or send any information that could personally identify you, your device or any other personal information.

**If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not install or uninstall the application. Permanently removing the application from the mobile device is equivalent to terminating the use of the application.**

### The main functions

The main functionality of the application is to collect cell tower identifiers, signal strength and the device location (coordinates). This information is stored locally on your device and will never be transmitted without your explicit consent and action. The collected data can be exported to the file persisted on your device or shared to OpenCellID.org and BeaconDB projects. To ensure the privacy is protected, the application does NOT use any proxy server that could access your data in transit. All the traffic to external services is encrypted using HTTPS protocol.

**Contribution to the OpenCellID.org** project requires a personal Access Token (API Key) that needs to be entered in the application preferences. The key will only be used to upload the measurements to the project database and will never leave the device in any other scenario. Anybody who knows the Access Token has full control over the uploaded data, including browsing and deleting. It's your responsibility to protect the confidentiality of your Access Token!

- [The OpenCellID.org privacy policy](https://community.opencellid.org/privacy)
- [The BeaconDB privacy notice](https://beacondb.net/privacy/)

Most of the features of the application require the **foreground location permission**, however, to start collecting measurements at device startup, the **background location permission** must be granted. The background location permission is required because, in this scenario, collecting is initiated by the system (in background), not by you (in foreground).

### The optional functions

The **map** feature uses the services provided by OpenStreetMap under [the terms of use](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use).

The **automatic update check** feature connects to the server to check if there is available a newer version of the application. The request contains the version of installed application and it is executed on the start of the application once a day.

The **Contact developer** feature will create a new email message in the selected email client. The message includes the following technical information about the device in order to help in troubleshooting:

- The application version
- The Android version
- The device manufacturer and model

The **Export preferences** or **Export database** feature will copy the application preferences or database to the dedicated folder on your device. If the files are placed on the shared memory, that any other application has access to, then the sensitive data (like the OpenCellID Access Token) may be unprotected.

The **file logging at Debug level** feature will create very detailed log files in the dedicated folder on your device. The log may contain the sensitive information, like your current location and the cell tower your device is connected to. This option should only be used temporarily for troubleshooting.

### The troubleshooting helpers

The application collects **the anonymous usage statistics**. The data is shared only with the developer, in order to help to better understand how application is being used, what are the execution times of various functions and what are the most popular features. The collected data is used to improve overall performance, usability and user experience. The data is collected using third party Google Analytics for Firebase library provided by Google under [the Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

The application has built-in the **automated crash reporting** system. The application failure reports are shared only with the developer and contain information about crash cause and device configuration. It does NOT include any information that can use used to identify you or the device.]]></string>
  <string name="usage_statistics_content"><![CDATA[Usage statistics is a form of anonymous feedback. It help developer to better understand how application is being used, how fast it is and what are most popular features. With this kind of knowledge it is much easier to improve overall performance, usability and user experience.

Tower Collector tracks and reports the following kinds of data:

- application failures;
- which features are used and how;
- time consuming operations duration;
- number of collected, exported and uploaded measurements (statistics only).

Real measurements data, access token and any other personal information is NOT being tracked. Reports are send automatically in the background. *If you treat your privacy very seriously, you can easily opt-out from collecting and sending usage statistics by unchecking option in Preferences.*]]></string>
